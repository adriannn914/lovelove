1. Your hair<br>
2. Your smile<br><br>
How could I only pick 3 things to love you?!<br><br>
I love your smile, your hair, your eyes, especially your laugh. I love everything about you because you are perfect and don't ever think otherwise<br><br><br><br>

I failed as your partner<br>
I failed as your comfort zone<br>
I failed as your safest place<br>
I'm so sorry my love:(<br>
I'll do anything for you, I'll do my best to be the better person you still deserve!<br>
